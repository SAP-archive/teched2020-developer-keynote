Sometimes you want to run a CAP application locally for testing purposes. If that application requires a connection to a remote service on the Cloud Foundry (CF) runtime of SAP Cloud Platform, you can do this by making service binding details available locally to that application. This is done using values in a specially named file `default-env.json`.

There are various ways to generate the contents needed for such a file, here's one.

## Scenario

The scenario here is where a CAP application running locally must connect to an instance of an SAP Enterprise Messaging service instance running in the CF runtime of an SAP Cloud Platform trial account. The instance name is `emdev`, as described in the [Message bus setup document](../../messagebus/).

It will also require the ability to read destination information defined in the SAP Cloud Platform subaccount, and for that it will also need a connection to instances of the destination service and the XSUAA service.

## Approach

The general idea being followed here is that service bindings can be generated by creating a simple app in that same CF space, and then binding the service instances to that app.

Subsequently, we can then use the standard `cf env` command to request the environment variables for that app, which will include the service binding information. Specifically we're looking for the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.

So the approach is to

- deploy a very simple app
- bind the service instances to it
- then request the environment variables

> The credentials in this binding context are only relevant as long as the bindings exist, so the app must remain while the credentials are to be used.

## Following the approach

There are two ways to follow this approach available here - you can do it manually, [step by step](#step-by-step), to understand what's happening. But there's also a small experimental [script](#using-a-script) that will perform all the steps for you, even the editing of the output from `cf env`, thanks to the venerable stream editor [`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html).

### Step by step

First, pick a temporary name for the app - we'll use this throughout these steps. Let's pick `mytempapp` for example.

First, make sure that there's no existing app already deployed with that name:

```sh
$ cf d -f mytempapp
```

Now deploy an empty app:

```sh
$ cf push --no-route --no-start -k 64M -m 32M mytempapp
```

Next, bind the service instances to the app:

```sh
$ cf bind-service mytempapp emdev
$ cf bind-service mytempapp destination-lite
$ cf bind-service mytempapp xsuaa-application
```

> This assumes that you not only already have an instance of the SAP Enterprise Messaging service, with the name `emdev`, but you also have instances of the Destination and XSUAA services too, with specific plans `lite` and `application` respectively. If not, create them with `cf create-service destination lite destination-lite` and `cf create-service xsuaa application xsuaa-application`. Note that the naming convention used here for the instances is `<servicename>-<planname>`.

Finally, request the environment information:

```sh
$ cf env mytempapp > default-env.txt
```

The output of `cf env` contains what we need, but also some extraneous information. So open the `default-env.txt` file up and edit it to leave just the JSON section containing the `VCAP_SERVICES` section, as shown here, i.e. remove everything except what's shown between the START and END cut lines.

```

Finally, now you have pure JSON in the file, rename it to `default-env.json` and you're done!

### Using a script

We've written a small script that will perform the steps above. The script is [`default-env-gen`](default-env-gen) and there's also the stream edit commands in [`default-env-gen.sed`](default-env-gen.sed).

The script expects a single mandatory argument - your choice of a name for the temporary app. It will then proceed to run through the above steps, and produce a `default-env.json` file. It will expect an existing instance of the SAP Enterprise Messaging service called `emdev` (but you can specify a different instance name as a second argument if you need to); it will also look for and bind existing Destination and XSUAA service instances with the specific names `destination-lite` and `xsuaa-application` respectively.

Here's a (slightly edited) example invocation:

```
user: brain $ ./default-env-gen temp1
Deleting app temp1 in org 14ee89fftrial / space dev as sapdeveloper@example.com...
OK
App temp1 does not exist.

This will have created a fresh `default-env.json` file for you, which will look something like this (some content removed for readability):

```json
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "enterprise-messaging": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    ...
    "instance_name": "emdev",
    "label": "enterprise-messaging",
    "name": "emdev",
    "plan": "dev",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "enterprise-messaging"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}
```
