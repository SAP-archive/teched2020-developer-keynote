In the delivery, the route proposal also takes the weight group into account.A particular customer always requires immediate delivery. You enter the appropriate shipping condition into the customer master record. This means that when you process orders for this customer, the system automatically proposes the express mail room as a shipping point and the quickest way to the airport as a route.If a shipping condition has been assigned to a sales document type in Customizing, this condition will be proposed by the system in the corresponding sales document. If there is no assignment, the system copies the relevant data from the corresponding customer master record of the sold-to party. You cannot change this value during delivery processing. The shipping condition will not be copied from the delivery into the shipment. The shipping condition is one of several criteria for selecting deliveries when you create a shipment.

      <Summary>Defines the value in a business document that the system uses together with the condition amount to calculate the condition value for the price condition.</Summary>
      <LongDescription>During the pricing process in a business document, for each condition type used in the pricing procedure, the system calculates the condition value as follows:For several calculation types (for example, A, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, W), the system multiplies the condition amount with the condition basis to calculate the condition value.For several calculation types (for example, A, C, D, E, F, H, I, M, N, O, P), the system multiplies the condition amount with the condition basis to calculate the condition value.For several calculation types (for example, C, D, E, F, H, I, M, N, O, P), the value of the condition basis refers to a unit of measure. If the unit of measure of the conditions basis differs from the unit of measure of the price condition (condition unit), the system automatically converts it into the unit of measure of the condition unit. For calculation types C, M, N, O, and P, the item quantity is the default value for the condition basis.For several calculation types (for example, A, B, H, I, J, K, W), the condition basis is a currency field and refers to a currency key field. Such a currency field in the context of pricing is called currency amount. If the currency key of the conditions basis (currency amount) differs from the currency key of the document, the system automatically converts the condition basis (currency amount) into the currency of the document. The system uses the exchange rates for the currencies that are defined in the general settings for currencies.For several calculation types (for example, A, B, H, I), the condition basis is a currency field and refers to a currency key field. Such a currency field in the context of pricing is called currency amount. If the currency key of the conditions basis (currency amount) differs from the currency key of the document, the system automatically converts the condition basis (currency amount) into the currency of the document. The system uses the exchange rates for the currencies that are defined in the general settings for currencies.Note: The standard number of decimal places for a currency is two.Currencies that use a different number of decimal places must in addition be entered into table TCURX, where you can explicitly define the number of decimal places, for example, zero decimals for Japanese yen JPY.Deviations are preconfigured depending on the currency, for example, zero decimals for Japanese yen JPY.If you have defined scales, the system uses the condition basis to determine the valid scale line with the corresponding condition amount.In usage-based pricing models, the usage corresponds to the condition basis.The condition basis can be aQuantityWeightVolumeCurrency AmountA sales order includes an item with a quantity of 120 pieces:The determined list price of USD 101 (condition amount) multiplied with the quantity of 120 pieces (condition basis) results in a condition value of USD 12120.Two discounts are applied to the item of this sales order:The first discount (-1 USD / PC) is based on the quantity ordered that is the condition basis equals the item quantity and the result is - 120 USD.The second discount (- 2 %) is calculated as a percentage which is applied to the results of the list price (USD 12120) and the first discount (- 120 USD). Its result (12000 USD) is the condition basis for the second discount. The result of the second discount is - 240 USD.</LongDescription>

If the condition includes a pricing scale, the condition amount or percentage displays the first line of the scale.The following examples illustrate how you can use the condition amount or percentage in different condition types:If you create a condition that includes prices (for example, prices for a material), you enter an amount.If you create a condition based on percentage, such as discounts or surcharges (for example, a customer-specific discount), you enter the value of a percentage.

You define a characteristic FRAME_MATERIAL that can have the values steel, aluminum, and carbon with the following surcharges:Steel: 0.0 USD per pieceAluminum: + 300 USD per pieceCarbon: + 1000 USD per pieceYou define three different variant condition keys FRAME_STEEL, FRAME_ALU, and FRAME_CARBON and maintain the above-mentioned surcharges as condition records. During order creation, you select the variant of the bike with the carbon frame. This will lead to a surcharge of 1000 USD that corresponds to the variant condition key FRAME_CARBON.</LongDescription>

      <LongDescription>During the pricing process in a business document, for each condition type used in the pricing procedure, the system calculates the condition value as follows:For several calculation types (for example, A, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, W), the system multiplies the condition amount with the condition basis to calculate the condition value.For several calculation types (for example, A, C, D, E, F, H, I, M, N, O, P), the system multiplies the condition amount with the condition basis to calculate the condition value.For several calculation types (for example, C, D, E, F, H, I, M, N, O, P), the value of the condition basis refers to a unit of measure. If the unit of measure of the conditions basis differs from the unit of measure of the price condition (condition unit), the system automatically converts it into the unit of measure of the condition unit. For calculation types C, M, N, O, and P, the item quantity is the default value for the condition basis.For several calculation types (for example, A, B, H, I, J, K, W), the condition basis is a currency field and refers to a currency key field. Such a currency field in the context of pricing is called currency amount. If the currency key of the conditions basis (currency amount) differs from the currency key of the document, the system automatically converts the condition basis (currency amount) into the currency of the document. The system uses the exchange rates for the currencies that are defined in the general settings for currencies.For several calculation types (for example, A, B, H, I), the condition basis is a currency field and refers to a currency key field. Such a currency field in the context of pricing is called currency amount. If the currency key of the conditions basis (currency amount) differs from the currency key of the document, the system automatically converts the condition basis (currency amount) into the currency of the document. The system uses the exchange rates for the currencies that are defined in the general settings for currencies.Note: The standard number of decimal places for a currency is two.Currencies that use a different number of decimal places must in addition be entered into table TCURX, where you can explicitly define the number of decimal places, for example, zero decimals for Japanese yen JPY.Deviations are preconfigured depending on the currency, for example, zero decimals for Japanese yen JPY.If you have defined scales, the system uses the condition basis to determine the valid scale line with the corresponding condition amount.In usage-based pricing models, the usage corresponds to the condition basis.The condition basis can be aQuantityWeightVolumeCurrency AmountA sales order includes an item with a quantity of 120 pieces:The determined list price of USD 101 (condition amount) multiplied with the quantity of 120 pieces (condition basis) results in a condition value of USD 12120.Two discounts are applied to the item of this sales order:The first discount (-1 USD / PC) is based on the quantity ordered that is the condition basis equals the item quantity and the result is - 120 USD.The second discount (- 2 %) is calculated as a percentage which is applied to the results of the list price (USD 12120) and the first discount (- 120 USD). Its result (12000 USD) is the condition basis for the second discount. The result of the second discount is - 240 USD.</LongDescription>
